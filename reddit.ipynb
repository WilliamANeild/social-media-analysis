In fact, not one of these \"analysts\" seems to see a ceiling - ever... If $NVDA were to grow another 43% over the next year, that would make it's market value greater than the entire GDP of Japan, and in fact only China and the US would have a higher total GDP than the market value of $NVDA. Does something have to give? What can explain this?
